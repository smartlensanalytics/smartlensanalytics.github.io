                        <h4>Your privacy is critically important to us.</h4>

                        <p>SmartLens Analytics, Inc. is located at:</p>
                        <address>75 E Santa Clara St Floor 6 , San Jose<br />CA - 95113, United States</address>
            
                        <p>It is SmartLens Analytics, Inc.’s policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our website.
                            This Privacy Policy applies to <a href="http://smartlensanalytics.com">smartlensanalytics.com</a> (hereinafter, "us", "we", or "smartlensanalytics.com").
                            We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting personally identifiable information you may provide us through the Website.
                            We have adopted this privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") to explain what information may be collected on our Website,
                            how we use this information, and under what circumstances we may disclose the information to third parties.
                            This Privacy Policy applies only to information we collect through the Website and does not apply to our collection of information
                            from other sources.</p>
                        <p>This Privacy Policy, together with the Terms and conditions posted on our Website, set forth the general rules and policies
                            governing your use of our Website. Depending on your activities when visiting our Website, you may be required to agree to
                            additional terms and conditions.</p>
            
                        <h2>Website Visitors</h2>
                        <p>Like most website operators, SmartLens Analytics, Inc. collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web
                            browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date
                            and time of each visitor request. SmartLens Analytics, Inc.’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information
                            is to better understand how SmartLens Analytics, Inc.’s visitors use its website. From time to time, SmartLens Analytics,
                            Inc. may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the
                            usage of its website.</p>
                        <p>SmartLens Analytics, Inc. also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP)
                            addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on <a href="http://smartlensanalytics.com">http://smartlensanalytics.com</a> blog posts.
                            SmartLens Analytics, Inc. only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances
                            that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below.</p>
                        
                        <h2>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
                        <p>Certain visitors to SmartLens Analytics, Inc.’s websites choose to interact with SmartLens Analytics, Inc.
                            in ways that require SmartLens Analytics, Inc. to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of
                            information that SmartLens Analytics, Inc. gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors
                            who sign up for a blog at <a href="http://smartlensanalytics.com">http://smartlensanalytics.com</a> to provide a username and email address.</p>
                        
                        <h2>Security</h2>
                        <p>The security of your Personal Information is important to us, but remember that no method of transmission over the Internet,
                            or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your
                            Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
                        
                        <h2>Advertisements</h2>
                        <p>Ads appearing on our website may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who may set cookies.
                            These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to
                            compile information about you or others who use your computer. This information allows ad networks to,
                            among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you.
                            This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by SmartLens Analytics, Inc. and does not cover the use of
                            cookies by any advertisers.</p>
                        
                        <h2>Links To External Sites</h2>

                            you will be directed to that third party's site. We strongly advise you to review the Privacy
                            Policy and terms and conditions of every site you visit.</p>
                        <p>We have no control over, and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies or practices of any
                            third party sites, products or services.</p>
                        
                        <h2>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h2>

                            in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when SmartLens Analytics, Inc. believes
                            in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of SmartLens Analytics, Inc.,
                            third parties or the public at large.</p>
